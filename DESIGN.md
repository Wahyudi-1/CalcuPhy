For my final project, I created a static website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I chose to publish it through GitHub Pages, which offers free hosting. My goal was to make a useful physics calculation tool accessible to anyone online. To build the site, I relied heavily on HTML for content and CSS for design. I added JavaScript to execute calculations and make the site responsive. I named the project CalcuPhy, short for Calculations in Physics. It allows users to calculate common physics problems. The site has a header, footer, and four main navigation links: Home, Calculations, Learning, and About.

The Home page explains the purpose and benefits of the site. To start calculating, users go to the Calculations page and select a broad topic. Specific calculation topics are hidden inside buttons to simplify the interface. The Learning page similarly lets users expand topics under main subjects. It provides explanatory videos to build physics knowledge. The About page shares background on me, the creator. From Calculation and Learning pages, clicking a subject and topic takes users to a page with relevant calculators or learning materials.

Calculation pages include unit converters to enter non-standard units into SI. Users choose which value to calculate via labeled buttons that reveal input fields. Entering quantities in SI units produces a bolded result in SI units below. Multiple calculations can be done per page by changing inputs. The navigation bar allows seamless transitions between pages. The footer contains my contact email for questions.

Overall, I aimed to create an easy-to-use physics learning and calculation site for anyone with an internet connection. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions!
