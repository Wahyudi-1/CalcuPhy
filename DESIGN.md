For my final project, I created a static website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I chose to publish it through GitHub Pages, which offers free hosting. My goal was to make a useful physics calculation tool accessible to anyone online. To build the site, I relied heavily on HTML for content and CSS for design. I added JavaScript to execute calculations and make the site responsive. I named the project CalcuPhy, short for Calculations in Physics. It allows users to calculate common physics problems. The site has a header, footer, and four main navigation links: Home, Calculations, Learning, and About.

For the CSS, I used selectors like body, container, header, h2, p, footer, navigation, button, a, and img to simplify styling rules in the HTML files. Each selector has its own unique properties to enhance the visual interface and make it look better. I linked the CSS to the HTML files using a link tag in the header of each HTML file.

For the HTML files, I created a file for each page as needed. For example, for the pages linked in the navigation bar, I have four pages: index.html for the home page, calculation.html for the calculations page, study.html for the understanding page, and about.html for the about me page. In the Calculations and Understanding pages, there are several broad physics topics comprised of multiple specific topics. So, I gave each specific topic its own page file. For instance, for the non-uniform linear motion calculation, I created its own page linked from the Calculations page. In each specific calculation page, I included navigation bars to go back to the main pages. I did the same for the understanding topic pages.

In each HTML file, I included the same code for the header, navigation bars, and footer. For the head of the HTML file, I put links for Bootstrap, CSS, responsive view meta tag, title, and JavaScript (if required by the page). For the body, I put the content. At the top of the body for each page is the navigation bar code, followed by the page-specific content. At the bottom of the HTML file is a footer containing brief author information and a link to email the author.

The Home page explains the purpose and benefits of the site. To start calculating, users go to the Calculations page and select a broad topic. Specific calculation topics are hidden inside expandable buttons to simplify the interface. Similarly, the Learning page lets users expand topics under main subjects. It provides explanatory videos to build physics knowledge. The About page shares background information about me, the creator. From the Calculations and Learning pages, clicking on a broad topic and then a specific topic takes users to a page with relevant calculators or learning materials.

The calculation pages include unit converters to enter non-standard units into SI units. Users choose which value to calculate via labeled buttons that reveal input fields. Entering quantities in SI units produces a bolded result in SI units below. Multiple calculations can be done on each page by changing the inputs. The navigation bar allows seamless transitions between pages. The footer contains my contact email for questions.

Each calculation page for a specific topic contains JavaScript to make it responsive and execute the calculation. So each specific calculation topic has its own JavaScript file. The length of the JavaScript depends on the number of labeled buttons for that specific calculation. To implement the specific calculations, I used labeled buttons neatly arranged in rows and columns that collapse when not in use. Inside each labeled button there are unique input fields. The number of inputs depends on the calculation type. At the bottom of the labeled buttons, there is a span that provides a place to display the calculation result. The span has its own unique ID.

Each calculation has its own independent JavaScript file. The JavaScript begins with document.addEventListener followed by variables for the inputs and result span. The next function calculates based on physics formulas, executing the inputs to produce the needed result. For unit conversion, the JavaScript executes based on the selected option. The unit conversion changes the result by converting the inputs or result units. I also provided JavaScript alert messages for unfinished pages. For the explanatory videos on the Understanding page, I used iframes to embed the videos from YouTube.

Overall, I aimed to create an easy-to-use physics learning and calculation site for anyone with an internet connection. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions!
